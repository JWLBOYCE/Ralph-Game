Place sound files here. The app looks for any of these and picks one at random for each bark:

- bark1.mp3
- bark2.mp3
- bark3.mp3
- bark4.mp3
- bark.mp3 (legacy single-file name)

Tips
- Use short, realistic dog barks (0.2â€“0.7s)
- Keep files small for fast loading
- Different barks with slight variations sound best

If none of these files are present, the app falls back to a synthesized bark.
