- **Natural Elements**: Trees, bushes, flowers, and grass
- **Fence Boundary**: Wooden fence surrounding the play area
- **Atmospheric Lighting**: Warm, inviting lighting setup

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### **Installation**
1. Clone or download this project
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. (Optional) Fetch a CC0/royalty‚Äëfree rigged dachshund model to vendor into the repo:
   - Provide a direct .glb URL via env var and run the fetcher:
     ```bash
     DACHSHUND_URL="<direct_cc0_dachshund_glb_url>" npm run fetch:dachshund
     ```
   - This saves the file to `public/models/dachshund.glb`. Add attribution text to `public/models/LICENSE-dachshund.txt` (or set `DACHSHUND_LICENSE` env var when running the fetch command).
   - Alternatively, you can drop your own `public/models/dachshund.glb` manually.

### **Running the Game**
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

3. Start exploring Ralph's 3D world!

If you didn‚Äôt vendor a model, the app falls back to a small, rigged Fox sample (CC0) until a dachshund model is added.

### **Building for Production**
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
